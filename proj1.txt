a- 6 clusters : 46 min ,3 seconds with 20 reduce tasks
b- 9 clusters : 43 min 42 seconds with 20 reduce tasks
c- 12 clusters: 29 min 2 seconds  with 40 reduce tasks

2- 
	a) 50th percentile : 4
	b) 9oth percentile :4
	c) 95th percentile :5

	a) 6 clusters  : 13.47 MB/second

	b) 9 clusters  : 14.19  MB/second
	
	c) 12 clusters : 21.37 MB/second


4- According to the previous result, one can see that the speed up of 9 and 12 clusters was faster than the one of 6 clusters.
 
  However, the speed of 12 is much faster also because I doubled the amount of reduce task (from 20 to 40). This is a confirmation

 that hadoop parellilazation enables program to work faster while adding more computers together. While waiting for the computer

 speed to increase, hadoop system will be very beneficial in order to run very long application. This a "strong scaling" since

 by adding more computers we have seen how faster the algorithm has been on the same set of data. If we draw a graph of speed vs number of clusters,

we will obtain an increasing monotnic curve, which implies that under parallelization, as the number of  computer increases,the speed of the

algorithm increases.


5- The combiner is an intermediary step between the map and the reduce.Its role is to aggregate all the intermediate outputs and compresses 

them which reduces the amount ofdata transferred between Mapper and Reducer. Its inclusion  does not affect performance much.

 I couldn't have used a combiner in the other mapreduces because if the keys are unique

   and are going to be reduced by different reducer functions, it doesn't make sense to combine the output of the mapper together
 
It wouldn't have changed that much on how the file would be compressed.

   a) 6 clusters : (0.68 * 6)/ (20.77 GB) = $ 0.19/GB

   b) 9 clusters : (0.68*9)/(20.77 GB) =   $ 0.29/GB
   
  c) 12 clusters : (0.68*12)/(20.77 GB)=  $ 0.39/GB

 (0.68 * 6) + (0.68*9) +  (0.68*12) = $ 18.36 = $ 19
